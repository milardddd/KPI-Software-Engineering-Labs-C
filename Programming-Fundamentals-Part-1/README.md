# KPI Software Engineering - C Programming Labs

This repository contains academic projects developed during my studies at **Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute (KPI), Faculty of Informatics and Computer Science (FIOT)**. It showcases a progression from basic programming constructs to complex algorithms and data structures implemented in C.

## 📂 Repository Structure

### 1. [Programming Fundamentals - Part 1: Core Constructs](./Programming-Fundamentals-Part-1)
This module contains the first 9 laboratory works, focusing on the foundational building blocks of software engineering:
* **Basic Logic & Math (Labs 1-3):** Implementation of time converters, geometric calculators, and calendar logic.
* **Sorting & Precision (Lab 4):** Optimized Bubble sort with EPSILON-based floating-point comparison.
* **Memory Management (Labs 5-6):** Working with dynamic arrays, pointer-to-pointer structures, and string sorting.
* **Numerical Methods (Labs 6-7):** Solvers for linear (SLAE) and non-linear equations using iterative methods and function pointers.
* **Mathematical Modeling (Lab 8):** Calculation of complex impedance for RLC electrical circuits in the frequency domain.
* **Data Persistence (Lab 9):** Managing records in binary files with custom signatures and CRUD operations.

### 2. [Algorithms and Data Structures](./Algorithms-and-Data-Structures)
Focuses on efficiency and advanced data organizations (Ongoing module):
* **Advanced Sorting:** Future implementations of Shell sort and recursive algorithms.
* **Search Techniques:** Linear and Binary search implementations for optimized data retrieval.
* **Dynamic Structures:** Management of linked lists, including element filtering and memory cleanup.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Language:** C (Standard C11)
* **Compiler:** GCC/Clang
* **Environment:** Unix-like (standard I/O, termios for terminal control)
