# KPI Software Engineering - C Programming Labs

This repository contains academic projects and laboratory works developed during my studies at **Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute (KPI)**. It showcases a progression from basic programming constructs to complex algorithms and data structures implemented in C.

## 📂 Repository Structure

### 1. [Programming Fundamentals - Part 1: Core Constructs](./Programming-Fundamentals-Part-1)
Focuses on the foundational building blocks of software engineering:
* **Basic Logic & Math:** Implementation of time converters and geometric calculators.
* **Numerical Methods:** Solvers for linear and non-linear equations using iterative methods.
* **Data Persistence:** Managing records in binary files with custom signatures and CRUD operations.
* **Memory Management:** Working with dynamic arrays and pointer-based string sorting.

### 2. [Algorithms and Data Structures](./Algorithms-and-Data-Structures)
Focuses on efficiency and complex data organizations:
* **Sorting Algorithms:** Practical implementations of Shell sort and Bubble sort.
* **Search Techniques:** Linear and Binary search implementations for optimized data retrieval.
* **Dynamic Structures:** Management of linked lists, including element filtering and memory cleanup.
* **Mathematical Modeling:** Calculation of complex impedance for electrical circuits in the frequency domain.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Language:** C (Standard C11)
* **Compiler:** GCC
* **Environment:** Unix-like (standard I/O, termios)
